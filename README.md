✋🏻 hi, this a sample project designed and coded by me, Ali Farahbakhsh. 👨🏻‍💻

In this project i used Html, Css, Bootstrap, React. its also completly responsive.

Take a look at it by clicking on the following link : https://alifrb.github.io/rick-and-morty/

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
